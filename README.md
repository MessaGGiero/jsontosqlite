# Json To SqLite🔥



**This project allows to import files with arrays of json files into a table in a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database created by the scope.
The project provides a graphical interface that facilitates operation.
The program also allows you to import json array files into your persistent [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database and allows you to export the database table into json array files.**

**🔸 Example of a json array contained in a file.**
```
[
    {
      "city": "Napoli",
      "address" : "Via delle rose 8",
      ...  
    },
    {
      "city": "Roma",
      "address" : "Via dei gerani 9",
      ...  
    }
    ...
]

```
**🔸 To read the data imported in the database created, you could use [sqlitebrowser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
